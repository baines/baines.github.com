I felt unusually inspired recently after seeing lots of awesome puzzle games
being made with [Puzzlescript](http://www.puzzlescript.net/).
Specifically, [Train Braining and Mirror Isles by Draknek](http://www.draknek.org/games/puzzlescript/)
which you should totally check out if you haven't already.

I'm no puzzle-game master like he is, but I had a go at making my own. I also 
don't claim to be good at naming things - that's why it's called 
"Lawn-Mowing Robot"...

The game plays a bit weirdly, but it's only 8 levels and runs in a browser, so
I'd love for you to give it a try from the link below.

It's my first proper puzzle game so if you have any comments or feedback drop me
an email. Thanks!
