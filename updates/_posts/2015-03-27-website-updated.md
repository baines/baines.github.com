I've spent some time updating the website to have a better front page and a
new updates section, the most recent of which appear on it. 

The new section will just be for informative but infrequent updates about the 
site (like this one!) or stuff I'm doing and wanted to share.

I also switched the site to HTTPS using a cloudflare free account. It seems to
be working well so far - I'm surprised they offer such a service for free
with seemingly no strings attached.
