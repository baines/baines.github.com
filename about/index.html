<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>My name is Alex Baines and I'm currently a Computer Science student
at The University of Warwick in the UK.</p>
<p>I enjoy programming and have made several small games in my spare time,
mainly for competitions held by
<a href="http://warwickgamedesign.co.uk/">Warwick Game Design</a>.
You can find them at the <a href="/games/">Games section</a> of this website.</p>
<p>If you would like to contact me, send an email to a.baines@warwick.ac.uk</p>
