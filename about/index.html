<div id="about">
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>My name is Alex Baines and I'm a Computer Science graduate
from The University of Warwick in the UK.</p>
<p>I enjoy programming and have made several small games in my spare time,
mainly for competitions held by
<a href="http://warwickgamedesign.co.uk/">Warwick Game Design</a>.
You can find them at the <a href="/games/">Games section</a> of this website.
Currently I'm working on some other small projects, like <a href="/other/libnrg/">libNRG</a>, a C++
networking library for games.</p>
<p>If you would like to contact me, send an email to <strong>a.baines@warwick.ac.uk</strong> which I still
have access to for the time being, or alternatively <strong>alex@<span id="e">[This Domain]</span></strong>.</p>
<p>You can also use <a href="/about/public-key.txt">this PGP public key</a> to encrypt any mail you send.
It should be listed on the pgp.mit.edu keyserver with ID AC38912D, and match the one
served over https by github <a href="https://github.com/baines/baines.github.com/blob/8d8c6e9cbbdccc70c1f8d5292edb3e77477fee4e/about/public-key.txt">here</a></p>
