<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>My name is Alex Baines and I'm a Computer Science graduate
from The University of Warwick in the UK.</p>

<p>I enjoy programming and have made several small games in my spare time,
mainly for competitions held by <br/>
<a href="http://warwickgamedesign.co.uk/">Warwick Game Design</a>.
You can find them at the <a href="/games/">Games section</a> of this website.</p>

<p>Currently I'm working on some other small projects, like 
<a href="/other/libnrg/">libNRG</a>, a C++ networking library for games, and a 
<a href="/other/game-engine/">basic SDL2/OpenGL3+ game engine</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to contact me, send an email to <strong>alex@<span id="e">[This Domain]</span></strong>.</p>

<p>You can also use <a href="/about/public-key.txt">this PGP public key</a> to encrypt any mail you send.

<strong>F7E3 273B BC8A 2194 BD38 AF1A 0F9D C969 AC38 912D</strong>, and match the one
