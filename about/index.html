<div id="about">
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>My name is Alex Baines and I'm a graduated Computer Science student
from The University of Warwick in the UK.</p>
<p>I enjoy programming and have made several small games in my spare time,
mainly for competitions held by
<a href="http://warwickgamedesign.co.uk/">Warwick Game Design</a>.
You can find them at the <a href="/games/">Games section</a> of this website.
Currently I'm working on some other small projects, like <a href="/other/libnrg/">libNRG</a>, a C++
networking library for games.</p>
<p>If you would like to contact me, send an email to a.baines@warwick.ac.uk which I still
have access to for the time being, or alternatively alex@<span id="e">[This Domain]</span>.</p>
