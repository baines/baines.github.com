Insobot is an IRC bot I started creating a while back, originally insprired by
other markov chain bots such as ChronalDragon's (as far as I know unreleased) chronal_robot.

After writing the original simple version in C++, I was interested in trying a
project in pure C, and decided to expand Insobot into a modular structure
and rewrite the markov chain functionality as one module for the new architecture.

Today Insobot has many more modules, for creating alias/macro commands, retrieving
info from the twitch.tv API, expanding youtube/twitter links, storing quotes in 
a gist on github, as well as letting people know the schedule for Handmade Hero.

The main Handmade Hero community bot, hmd_bot, is based on insobot's code with a 
few additional modules added, and some removed.

The markov chain module still remains the most noteworthy part of insobot though,
leading to quite a few humourous moments, some of which I pointed out in 
[this update](/updates/dares-bots-port-oh-my/#insobot).
