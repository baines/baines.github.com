This is an ncurses music player for .gbs chiptune files. The UI shows the
realtime values of the GameBoy's audio registers, highlighting values
as they change; The pitch and octave of the wave & square channels are also shown
in more traditional form, using the letters A though G, and numbers 0-9.

It has fairly intuitive controls for volume, toggling channels, changing the
tempo, etc, and sounds pretty accurate for most of the tracks that I've
tested. It also works with "Prehistorik Man", which uses some tricks
that other players don't properly emulate, though it won't currently work with
a few tracks that expect to do their own cycle-based timing.

With the name *Mini*GBS, it was designed to have a pretty small code footprint;
The bulk of it is ~1.5k lines spread between 2 c files. Currently it doesn't
come bundled with any songs, so you'll have to find them yourself, but I have
started working on a GB sound driver and hope to make some original .gbs music
available in the future!
