LibNRG (Networking for Real-time Games) is a C++ library that I first started
working on for my third-year project at university. It's supposed to provide an
easy-to-use interface built on UDP sockets for use in fast-paced multiplayer games.

The initial version worked pretty well, but I have since wanted to add features, 
clean parts up, and maybe even get around to finally producing some proper 
documentation for it. So because of this, it hasn't been released yet.

Eventually I'll get around to releasing it on github fully open source and zlib-licensed,
but for now I'm just going to release the specification and final report that
I produced at uni.
