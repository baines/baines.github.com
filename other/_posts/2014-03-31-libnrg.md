LibNRG (Networking for Real-time Games) is a C++ library that I first started
working on for my third-year project at university. It's supposed to provide an
easy-to-use interface built on UDP sockets for use in fast-paced multi-player games.

The initial version that I finished at uni worked pretty well, but there was 
still lots of room for improvement, so I continued working on it off and on since then.
There are still a lot of things that I would like to eventually add / change,
(especially better documentation!) but regrettably I haven't spent the time to 
finish them yet.

Despite this, the library *does* work, so I'm open-sourcing it today under the zlib
license, like I said I would in the project's final report. Maybe someone will
find it useful.

[You can find it on GitHub here.](https://github.com/baines/libNRG)

I've also made the specification and final report that I produced at uni available
below.
