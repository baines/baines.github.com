LibNRG (Networking for Real-time Games) is a C++ library that I first started
working on for my third-year project at university. It aims to provide an
easy-to-use interface built on UDP sockets for use in fast-paced multi-player games.

The initial version that I finished at uni worked pretty well, but there was 
still lots of room for improvement, so I've continued to work on it occasionally 
since then.

The current version is a bit better, with more useful features like the Message 
RPC mechanism, but the library isn't finished and I'm not sure it ever will be.

It's open source under the zlib license though, so you can take a look / use it 
/ make changes or improvements as you see fit. Patches, pull requests and 
suggestions are welcome.

I've also made the specification and final report that I produced at uni 
available below.
