For anyone interested, I made this site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/),
which is a static site generation tool, mainly intended for blogs. With a bit of
hackery I've made it work for generating this set of posts in the "other" section,
as well as the items in the games section from a set of markdown files.

The site is also open source, you can find the pre-statically-generated version
on github [right here](https://github.com/baines/baines.github.com). The site is
also currently hosted from github's servers using their pages system that
incorporates jekyll, so that the site is automatically regenerated whenever
I make a commit - isn't that nice!
