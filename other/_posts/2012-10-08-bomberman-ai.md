title: Bomberman AI Bot
---

This is a really basic bomberman AI bot that I wrote for a 
[competition](https://github.com/UWCS/bomberman-progcomp) held
by the [University of Warwick Computing Society](https://uwcs.co.uk/) (UWCS).

It won the competition by quite a margin, but only because the other competitors
never dropped any bombs and only did random walks. (Zed0's bot didn't even go
that far iirc :p).

You can find the Java source code [here](https://github.com/baines/bomberman-ai).
